			<h2>Patterns of hyper-productive software organisations</h2>
			<p>One of my passions (or vice:-) is software engineering. Software engineering is all about people; the soonest we realise this, the better.  Especially all those fools that believe people are like software... interchangeable components of a system!</p>
			<p>An area which is of great importance (and interest to me) is that of "Organisational Patterns of Hyper Productive Software Development Organisations".</p>
			<p>Seminal work on this area was first conducted by James O. Coplien and the 'Pasteur' team at Bell Labs.</p>
			<p>Hyper productive teams tend to share some common organisational patterns, which we can observe, learn from and implement ourselves.</p>
			<p>Organisational patterns can be described as organisational structures (or configurations if you prefer) that enable the people within them to be highly productive (as opposed to get in their way like a cathedral like org chart).</p>
			<p>Organisational patterns  provide a kit (not a religion) of organisational structures that can be employed according to needs of an organisation. These are based on values and principles as opposed to process fads or yet another methodology or maybe dogma. </p>		
			<br/><br/>
			
			<h3>Organisational improvement</h3>
			<p>This work, shows a path to organisational improvement, which leads to dramatic increase in productivity and fun for a software producing organisation. I know because I have experienced what happens when you apply them and unfortunately what goes wrong when you break them down (more of the latter actually for my bad luck).</p>
			<p>In the past 12 years, this empirical research has  documented and analysed what works in software production.</p>
			<p>By learning from these documented and empirical studies we can improve our software producing organisations.</p>
			<p>Pick up the book or go to the online resources.</p>
			<p>Coplien and Harrison have spent more than a decade researching and observing highly productive software organisations, in order to capture and document the patterns that made them so productive.</p>
			<p>Finally all this knowledge has been captured please make use of it!</p>

				<h3>Help with Organisational Patterns</h3>
				<p>if you need help with implementing organisational improvement I suggest you contact Coplien, Harrison or Bj&oslash;rnvig themselves.</p>
				<p>Tietoenator offer an <a href="http://www.tietoenator.dk/default.asp?path=487;616;16089;1183;8172;18301;18431">Organizational Agility Program</a>, which has been created in consultation with James O. Coplien.</p>

				<h3>Some common characteristics of highly productive organisations</h3>
				<p><strong>Keep Organisation Simple:</strong><br/><em>Fewer roles in the organisation, usually not much more than a dozen.</em></p>
				<p><strong>Unity of purpose:</strong><br/><em>Team members share a common vision and purpose.</em></p>
				<p><strong>Work flows inward:</strong><br/><em>The role of the developer is in the centre where information flows from producers of information to consumers of information (developers). The role of the developer is thus supported by the other roles</em></p>
				<p><strong>Iterate, iterate!</strong>:<br/><em>For these organisations, the traditional waterfall model of software  development exists only on paper. Also design and coding were inseparably  inter-wined.</em></p>
				<p><strong>Distribute work evenly:</strong><br/><em>Don't allow the focus on any developers to become extreme, hence distribute communication around. Even the most central role would not have to deal with disproportionate amounts of communication or work.</em></p>
				<p><strong>Compensate success:</strong><br/><em>With celebrations, good salaries and other reward structures ;-)</em></p>
